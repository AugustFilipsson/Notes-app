## Project Overview
I want to create a simple website that handles notes. The website should be able to create, read, update, and delete notes. The website should be extendable so I can extend on it later with more features. The website should follow the latest best practices both architecturally and code wise. This is for educational purposes.

## Requirements
- A note should have the properties: title, text, last updated timestamp, created timestamp, and an ID that is not visible to the user.
- No data storage for now, in-memory only.
- CRUD operations for the notes.
- Frontend code inside of the .NET solution nested in a folder.
- No error handling for now.

### Frontend
- Framework & version, Angular 19.
- Key features CRUD.
- UI expectations, simple and modern.
- Use the latest best practices for Angular development.
- Some console logs for debugging, but not too many.
- The .NET backend should serve the Angular frontend.

### Backend
- Language & version, .NET 9
- Object oriented .NET solution, where one note is an object etc.
- API requirements, RESTful, endpoints, data models, data in JSON format.
- No data storage for now, in-memory only.
- Separation of concern. Separate layers for endpoints, business logic, data management.
- Use the latest best practices for .NET development.
- Some console logs for debugging, but not too many.

### General
- Authentication needs, none.
- Deployment/hosting preferences, local.
- Testing requirements, none for now.
- Documentation expectations, comments in code, moderate.
- Create a README with setup instructions.
- Any extra features, none.
- User management, none.
- Will later be deployed to a GitHub repository. But only hosted locally.
- The .NET backend should serve the Angular frontend.

## Deliverables
- A fully working .NET 9 solution that will build and run locally.
- A folder inside of the .NET solution with the Angular frontend code.
- A README with setup instructions.
